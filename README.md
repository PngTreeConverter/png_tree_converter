## Project description
This is a final project for the Architecture of Large Projects in Bioinformatics course. 
The goal of the project is motivated by the struggle to analyse, convert and download phylogenetic trees 
found in scientific articles. 

We propose Png Tree Converter - an online tool converting phylogenetic trees in image format (.png) to newick format. 
Our approach is based on custom image processing algorithms.
As furthert improvement, the tool may create visualisations of trees using Biopython library.

### Main tasks:
1. Extract dendrogram structure from .png image for binary, rooted trees oriented vertically 
(having leaves at the bottom of the image)
2. Extract leaf names
3. Write dendrogram data to a newick file

### Minor/extra tasks:
* Create an online tool using ```Streamlit```,
* adjust the algorithm for different tree orientations,
* create online tree visualisations (toytree, biopython etc.).
