## Project description
This is a final project for the Architecture of large projects in bioinformatics course. 
The goal of the project is motivated by the struggle to analyse, convert and download phylogenetic trees 
found in scientific articles. 

We propose Pdf Tree Converter - an online / command line (to be decided later)
tool converting phylogenetic trees in image format (.png, .pdf) to a selected text file format (newick, phylo, nexus). 
Our approach is based on computer vision algorithms - edge detection with use of convolutional layer.
The tool can create visualisations of trees using BioPython and toytree libraries.
